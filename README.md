#Key Features

Implementation of algorithms to generate the variables and create a population.

Sampling from the population to analyze statistics.

Estimation of different distribution parameters.

Computation of confidence intervals.

Hypothesis testing.

Automatic classification of patients into categories based on their D, E, and H values.

#Dependencies

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

SciPy
